TODO: 
- [ ] Do MIT second week code walk through
- [ ] Udemy RNN Before MIT code walk throughs --> Take Notes during lessons
- [ ] Redo First week code walk through --> Take notes on what is confusing and where the misunderstanding comes from
- [ ] Make a couple RNN's --Still Need to find topics--
- [ ] Do MIT third week code walk through
- [ ] Learn about biometric gait recognition
- [ ] Reserach adversarial models
- [ ] Q-Learning?
- [ ] SARSA?
- [ ] make reinforce learning for checkers, chess, snake (don't make the games tho)
- [ ]  make computer vision person classifier with raspberry pi
- [ ] Start reseraching more computer vision and reinforcement learning models
- [ ] learn to make general models
- [ ] bot to learn to scrape the web

COMPLETE:
-finish making cnn mnist model
-try to use it and get the results
-Read about padding
-look into alphago movie
-Read over and improve Cnn with machinelearningmsatery article kfold model
-Continue to improve the cnnAfterOptimize
-Make another cnn model --> Use CIFAR10 dataset
-Read about data augmentation
-Add Data Augmentation to Model
-Read about available models on Keras

MAIN FOCUS: Reinforced Learning and Computer Vision
